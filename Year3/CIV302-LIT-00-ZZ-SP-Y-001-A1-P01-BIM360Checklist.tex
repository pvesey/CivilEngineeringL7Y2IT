	BIM 360 Checklists: Creation and Use}\\
\end{flushleft}

In this assignment you will create an accessibility checklist in BIM 360, and use that checklist to examine the ground floor of the Students' Union Building.  The key deliverables for this project are

\begin{enumerate}
	\item BIM360 Accessibility Checklist Template
	\item Completed Checklist Survey, including images and issues
	\item Documentation and Report of Survey 
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Scope}\\


You have been provided with a sample check-list produced by the Government of Northern Ireland.  This is a paper based survey and therefore has limitations.  You need to digitise this check-list and create a survey of the Students' Union Building

	\item Test your initial template, and revise as necessary
	\item Complete the live onsite survey, creating issues and markups as necessary
	\item Compile survey data, including all issues and images into a comprehensive report.
